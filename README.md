# Rt1_assignment2

The aim of this assignment is to become more familiar with **ros**, by developing three ( or four if you want) nodes of a given 3D **Gazebo* and **Rviz** simulation.
The four nodes consist in:
* A node that allows the user to set a goal position ( x, y coordinates) or cancell it;
* A node that publish the current robot position ( x, y coordinates) and velocity ( x, y coordinates);
* A service node that prints the number of goals reached and cancelled;
* A node that print the euclidian distance from the target, and its average speed;
In addition it is required to create **launch file**, which is used to start the whole program and, pass as parameters, the rate for printing the information of last node.
